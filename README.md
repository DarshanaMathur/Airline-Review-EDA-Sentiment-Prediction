# Airline-Review-EDA-Sentiment-Prediction
Welcome to this Repository!

This repository is all about extensive feature engineering, Data Cleaning, Manipulating and Wrangling. 

Here we have taken the data set for the airline review left by verified customers on a British Website. We have first performed Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis after which we have prepared data for prepairing our model for Sentiment Prediction.

We have prepared a model of around 98% accuracy. Please Note that, the other data files required are generated within the code. Only one initial data file is required to start off with the code. 

Thank you!
